ChronoShare: Decentralized File Sharing Over NDN
================================================

ChronoShare provides services similar to Dropbox, but in a decentralized way. 

It uses [ChronoSync](http://www.named-data.net/techreport/TR008-chronos.pdf) library to synchronize the operations to the shared-folder and levels NDN's advantage of natural multicast support. The sharing process is completely decentralized, but it is also very easy to add a permanent storage server. 

ChronoShare also provides file history and basic version control.
